**Agent-native tool intelligence.** Discover, evaluate, and execute external tools — with trust scores, failure modes, cost-aware routing, and managed credentials.

## Start in 30 seconds

### MCP (recommended)

```bash
npx rhumb-mcp@latest
```

Zero config. Discovery tools work immediately — no signup, no API key.

For execution, pass your Rhumb API key:

```bash
RHUMB_API_KEY=your_key npx rhumb-mcp@latest
```

[Get an API key →](https://rhumb.dev/auth/login)

### API (read-only, no auth)

```bash
curl "https://api.rhumb.dev/v1/services/stripe/score"
```

All read endpoints are public.

## What Rhumb does

Agents need external tools. Choosing the right one is hard — not because of feature lists, but because of:

- auth and signup friction
- provisioning reality vs. marketing claims
- schema instability
- failure recovery when no human is watching
- hidden costs and rate limits

Rhumb makes those constraints visible before you commit.

### Rhumb Index — Discover & Evaluate

**695 scored services** across 50+ domains. Each gets an [AN Score](https://rhumb.dev/methodology) (0–10) measuring execution quality, access readiness, and agent autonomy support.

- `find_services` — search by capability, domain, or name
- `an_score` — full score breakdown with dimension-level detail
- `get_alternatives` — ranked alternatives for any service
- `get_failure_modes` — known failure patterns before you integrate

### Rhumb Resolve — Execute

**414 capabilities** across 23 providers. Cost-aware routing picks the best provider for each call.

- `execute_capability` — call a capability through Resolve with managed auth
- `resolve_capability` — see ranked providers before executing
- `estimate_capability` — get cost estimate before committing
- Budget enforcement, credential management, and execution telemetry included

### Three credential modes

| Mode | How it works |
|------|-------------|
| **BYO** | Bring your own API key — Rhumb routes, you authenticate |
| **Rhumb-managed** | Rhumb holds the credential — zero setup for the agent |
| **Agent Vault** | Your key, encrypted and stored — Rhumb injects at call time |

### Payment paths

- **API key** — sign up, get a key, prepaid credits
- **x402 / USDC** — no signup, pay per call on-chain

## Score disputes

Every score is disputable. If you believe a score is inaccurate:

1. [Open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/supertrained/rhumb/issues/new) with evidence
2. Or email [providers@supertrained.ai](mailto:providers@supertrained.ai)

Negative findings remain visible. Rhumb does not accept payment to change scores.
